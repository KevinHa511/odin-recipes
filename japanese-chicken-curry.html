<p><h4><em>Delicious</em> chicken curry that originated in japan, a must save recipe!</h4> 
    <p>I know some of you are probably surprised to hear there is a Japanese version of curry, 
        but neither have I until I was stationed in Okinawa. The recipe consist of caramelized onions, grated apples, potatoes, carrots and rice.
        It's not as spicy as other curries around the world, so it is also a great choice for children. 
    </p>

<p><h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <p><ul><li>400g/0.9lb onion sliced into 1cm wide pieces.</li>
        <li>250g/.6lb potato cut into 1.5cm cubes.</li>
        <li>100g/3.5oz carrot sliced to 7mm pieces.</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of oil.</li>
        <li>1/2 packet of 230g/.5lb "house Vermont Curry"</li>
        <li>800ml/1.7pt water.</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice.</li>
        <li>4 Chicken Cutlets cut into 2.5cm/1" wide strips.</li> 
    </ul>

<p><h4>Steps</h4>

    <p><ol><li>Add oil into a pot and heat over medium high heat.</li>
            
            <li> Add onion and sauté for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and edges start getting slightly burnt.</li>
            
            <li>Add potatoes and carrots into the pot and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked.</li>
            
            <li>Add water and turn the heat up to bring it to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for about 7 minutes or until the vegetables are nearly cooked through.</li>

            <li>Break the curry roux cake into small blocks along the lines and add them into the pot. Stir gently to blend the curry roux.</li>
            
            <li>Place a lid on and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes or until the curry roux is completely dissolved. Stir occasionally.</li>
            
            <li>Check the consistency of the sauce. It should be like béchamel sauce. If too thick, adjust with some water. If too thin, cook further without the lid. It will thicken when cooled down as well.
                Turn the heat off.</li>
            
            <li>Turn the heat off</li>

            <li>Place a cup of hot cooked rice onto one side of a plate. Place the chicken cutlet pieces next to the rice, leaning them on the rice so that there will be a space to pour the curry.</li>

            <li>Pour curry next to the chicken cutlet and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
